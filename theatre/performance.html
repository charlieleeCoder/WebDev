                        Ancient Greek theatre was a theatrical culture that flourished in ancient Greece from 700 BC. 
                        The city-state of Athens, which became a significant cultural, political, and religious place during this period, was its centre, 
                        where the theatre was institutionalised as part of a festival called the Dionysia, which honoured the god Dionysus. Tragedy (late 500 BC), comedy (490 BC), 
                        and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies. Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, 
                        from the theatre of ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements.

                        The Greeks valued the power of the spoken word, and it was their main method of communication and storytelling. 
                        Bahn and Bahn write, "To Greeks the spoken word was a living thing and infinitely preferable to the dead symbols of a written language." 
                        Socrates himself believed that once something has been written down, it lost its ability for change and growth. 
                        For these reasons, among many others, oral storytelling flourished in Greece.

                        The dramatic performances were important to the Athenians – 
                        this is made clear by the creation of a tragedy competition and festival in the City Dionysia. 
                        This was organised possibly to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica (recently created by Cleisthenes). 
                        The festival was created roughly around 508 BC. While no drama texts exist from the sixth century BC, the names of three competitors besides Thespis are known: Choerilus, Pratinas, and Phrynichus. Each is credited with different innovations in the field.

                        Most ancient Greek cities lay on or near hills, so seating was generally built into the slope of a hill, 
                        producing a natural viewing area known as the theatron (literally "seeing place"). In cities without suitable hills, banks of earth were piled up. 
                        At the foot of the hill was a flattened, generally circular performance space with an average diameter of 78 feet (24 m), 
                        known as the orchestra (literally "dancing place"), where a chorus of typically 12 to 15 people performed plays in verse accompanied by music. 
                        There were often tall, arched entrances called parodoi or eisodoi, through which actors and chorus members entered and exited the orchestra. In some theatres, behind the orchestra, was a backdrop or scenic wall known as the skené.

                        The term theatre eventually came to mean to the whole area of theatron, orchestra, and skené.

                        A mechane or machine was a crane used in Greek theatre, especially in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. 
                        Made of wooden beams and pulley systems, the device was used to lift an actor into the air, usually representing flight. 
                        This stage machine was particularly used to bring gods onto the stage from above, hence the Latin term deus ex machina ("god from the machine"). Euripides' use of the mechane in Medea (431 BC) is a notable use of the machine for a non-divine character. It was also often used by Aeschylus. 
                        It was used to allow actors playing gods to fly through the air.

                    <p class="col-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-8 right-info">
                        Aristotle (in the Poetics 15 1454b1) was the first to use a Greek term equivalent to the Latin phrase deus ex machina to describe the technique as a device to resolve the plot of tragedies. 
                        It is said by one person to be undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author. 
                        The reasons for this are that it damages the story's internal logic and is often so unlikely that it challenges the reader's suspension of disbelief.

                        ... [the poet] ought always to seek what is either necessary or probable, so that ... it is either necessary or probable that this [incident] happen after that one. 
                        It is obvious that the solutions of plots, too, should come about as a result of the plot itself, and not from a contrivance, as in the Medea and in the passage about sailing home in the Iliad.
